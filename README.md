# Turnz

### Why Make this? :
This was made for an Advanced Programming class to learn low-level programming and 
learn how a game engine might be structured.

### About Turnz :
Turnz is a project based on the SDSU 2014 Progring Design Competition problem.
The game consists of a  11 x 11 grid and a blob. The premise of the game is, 
you rotate the game board to make the blob fall into the end point.
